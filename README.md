# Home Assistant - Nexa Bridge X Integration

This is a custom integration for Home Assistant that integrates with the [Nexa Bridge X](https://nexa.se/nexa-bridge-x).

Makes it possible to view and control devices set up in the Nexa App (or Admin Web UI).

## Features

> See [help](#help) below if you want to see support for more devices. I don't personally own every single type, and this hub supports devices with different protocols.

* Monitor energy use
* Monitor switch states
* Monitor dimmer switch states
* Control switches
* Control dimmer switches
* Control lights

## Installation

### Automatic

* Install and open https://hacs.xyz/
* Click on download button
* Search for "Nexa Bridge X" and download
* Restart HA

If for some reason the search comes up empty, select the hamburger menu and add a custom
repository with the URL to this repo and select the integration type.

### Manual

* In your HA installation ensure that a folder named `custom_components` exists in your configuration directory
* Download this repository
* Place `custom_components/nexa_bridge_x` inside your `custom_components` folder.

## Setup

Add the integration in HA settings and set up the correct connection credentials.

All connected devices will appear automatically as entities with names based on features and configuration.

> Note that names are based on device configuration in the Nexa Admin UI. Rooms are not taken into account.
